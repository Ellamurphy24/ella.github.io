  <h1>📜 Teen Data Protection Act</h1>
  <p>The Teen Data Protection Act, also known as <strong>Ella’s Digital Bill of Rights</strong>, is a youth-led legislative proposal designed to reclaim control over how data is collected, used, and exploited online. It establishes clear protections for minors under 18 and challenges the systems that profit from youth surveillance.</p>

  <h2>🎯 Core Digital Rights for Teens</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>🚫 No targeted advertising to users under 18 — no loopholes</li>
    <li>🛑 Opt-in data collection only — teens must give clear, informed consent</li>
    <li>📄 Mandatory plain-language privacy notices for all platforms used by teens</li>
    <li>🧽 Guaranteed right to delete all data at any time, without retaliation or delay</li>
    <li>🏫 Ban on student data being shared or sold by schools and education platforms</li>
    <li>🔍 Transparent algorithm rights — teens can request how recommendation engines profile them</li>
    <li>🧠 Required digital literacy education about privacy, data tracking, and algorithmic manipulation</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Preamble</h3>
  <p>Youth today exist online by necessity, not choice. Our data is collected, sold, and used to manipulate us before we’re old enough to vote. This law protects our digital freedom, privacy, and power — because we deserve to grow up without being farmed for profit.</p>

  </ul>

  <h3>Section II – Right to Data Deletion</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Any user under 18 (or their guardian) may request permanent deletion of all stored data.</li>
    <li>Platforms must comply within 15 days and may not use dark patterns to delay or discourage requests.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Section III – Ban on Surveillance Advertising</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>No platform may serve targeted ads based on behavior, location, or profiling to any user under 18.</li>
    <li>Contextual ads are allowed only with full transparency and opt-out options.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Section IV – Algorithmic Transparency</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Platforms must disclose how recommendation systems operate and allow minors to opt out.</li>
    <li>Teens must have the right to reset or de-customize their algorithmic profiles.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Section V – Enforcement</h3>

    <li>A Teen Privacy Division will be established within the FTC to enforce this law.</li>
    <li>Companies in violation may be fined up to $100,000 per affected minor.</li>
